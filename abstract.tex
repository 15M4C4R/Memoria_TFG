\chapter*{Abstract}
For a whole generation, the gateway to digital entertainment did not require powerful consoles or lengthy installations, but simply a browser window. The author's childhood was defined by the immediacy and accessibility of web games, where fun, whether solo or shared online, was just a click away. However, with the obsolescence of technologies like Flash, that simplicity has given way to more closed and complex ecosystems.

This Final Degree Project, titled King and Peasant, is born from the personal motivation to recover that nostalgic essence, reconstructing the experience of classic browser gaming under the standards of modern software engineering. The project presents a real-time multiplayer card platform developed with a MERN architecture (MariaDB, Express, React, Node.js) and WebSockets. Beyond the game mechanics, the system focuses on the social interaction that characterized those communities, implementing user search, friend lists, and dynamic waiting rooms (lobbies). All of this, deployed through Docker containers, demonstrates how current web technologies allow us to revive the magic of the past with the security, scalability, and performance of the present.
